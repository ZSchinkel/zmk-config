Keyboard Designer: [clicketysplit.ca](https://clicketysplit.ca)
GitHub: [ClicketySplit](https://github.com/ClicketySplit)
Hardware Supported: Pro Micro, Elite-C, and nice!nano v2

Leeloo v2 has been designed from scratch—again.  Everything from the wiring schematic to its case.  Leeloo v2 still keeps the column stagger that it's known for, along with its low profile design.

## Features/Differences from Leeloo v1
* Support for Kailh Low Profile Choc switches with 18mm x 18mm spacing.
  - A version for Kailh Box/MX switches with 19.05mm x 19.05mm spacing will be available in the future.
* All switch locations are socketed.
* Rotary encoder locations are socketed.
  - One of two locations on each side can be used for a rotary encoder.
* OLED Displays and nice!view Displays are natively supported, socketed, and no extra wiring is required.
* Support for per-switch RGB underglow.
* Better location for 110mAh or 700mAh batteries.
  - Different location for soldering battery leads.
* Support for Alps Alpine Micro On/off switches.

* Support for both 110mAh or 700mAh batteries.
* Solder pads for battery leads.
* Support for Alps Alpine Micro On/off switches.

# Building Leeloo's ZMK Firmware
ZMK Firmware: [Introduction to ZMK](https://zmk.dev/docs/)
Installation: [Installing ZMK](https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup)

Build commands for the default keymap of Leeloo v1:
```
west build -d build/left -p -b nice_nano_v2 -- -DSHIELD=leeloo_left
west build -d build/right -p -b nice_nano_v2 -- -DSHIELD=leeloo_right
```

Build commands for the default keymap of Leeloo v2:
```
west build -d build/left_v2 -p -b nice_nano_v2 -- -DSHIELD=leeloo_rev2_left
west build -d build/right_v2 -p -b nice_nano_v2 -- -DSHIELD=leeloo_rev2_right
```

Build commands for your custom keymap of Leeloo v1:
```
west build -d build/right -p -b nice_nano_v2 -- -DSHIELD=leeloo_right -DZMK_CONFIG="C:/dev/zmk/[yourName]/leeloo/config"
west build -d build/left -p -b nice_nano_v2 -- -DSHIELD=leeloo_left -DZMK_CONFIG="C:/dev/zmk/[yourName]/leeloo/config"
```

Build commands for your custom keymap of Leeloo v2:
```
west build -d build/right_v2 -p -b nice_nano_v2 -- -DSHIELD=leeloo_rev2_right -DZMK_CONFIG="C:/dev/zmk/[yourName]/leeloo_v2/config"
west build -d build/left_v2 -p -b nice_nano_v2 -- -DSHIELD=leeloo_rev2_left -DZMK_CONFIG="C:/dev/zmk/[yourName]/leeloo_v2/config"
```

## Building Leeloo's ZMK Firmware with nice!view Displays
There are a couple of files that need to be adjusted before the build commands can be run.

### Edit the leeloo[_rev2].keymap File
Near the top 3rd of the leeloo[_rev2].keymap file, locate the following code block:

```
//nice_view_spi: &spi0 {
//	cs-gpios = <&pro_micro 4 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
//};
```

Remove the forward slashes to resemble the following:
```
nice_view_spi: &spi0 {
	cs-gpios = <&pro_micro 4 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
};
```

Save your changes and close the file.
